# pygame-networking-example
This is a example of a networked client/server based multiplayer example made in Python 3.10.6, using PyGame 2.1.2 for graphics and input.

All of these modules use localhost for networking, the server and client(s) need to be run on the same machine.

The client does not start if the server is not running.
The client will crash if server closes while client is open.
